I did not start my career in tech.

I began working with my hands, building things, solving practical problems, and learning how real businesses operate under real constraints. Even in those early roles, I was always drawn to automating tasks, building small tools, and writing code to make work more efficient. Long before it was part of my job title, coding was something I did out of curiosity and enjoyment.

Over time, I moved from carpentry into sales, project oversight, and operations for a small construction business. In every role I held, I found myself building spreadsheets, scripts, and internal tools to replace manual processes and reduce friction. That pattern became clear to me over time: I was consistently using software to solve problems, even when it was unofficial.

That realization pushed me toward computer science.

I went back to school to formally study computer science and mathematics, where I focused on backend systems, data, and problem solving at scale. Along the way, I continued building software for the same business I worked in, replacing spreadsheets, manual tracking, and fragmented workflows with custom systems I designed and implemented end to end. These projects were not academic exercises. They were deployed, used, and iterated on based on real feedback.

Today, I build software with an owner's mindset. I care about clarity, maintainability, and outcomes. I am most engaged when I can take responsibility for a system from design through production and understand how it fits into a larger whole. I enjoy working close to real problems, where technical decisions are shaped by actual constraints rather than theory alone.

My background outside of tech continues to shape how I work within it. I am pragmatic, comfortable wearing multiple hats, and focused on building things that last. I am continuing to grow as a software engineer, with a particular interest in backend development, data driven systems, and tools that simplify complex workflows.

Outside of work, I value creativity, family, and balance. I play guitar, I am a father to a young son, and I share my home with two cats. These parts of my life ground how I approach my work. I am transitioning into tech not as a novelty or a shortcut, but because it is a place where I have always felt drawn, and where my problem solving mindset, creativity, and sense of ownership genuinely belong.
