My name is Jake Estrada.

I always wanted to build software.

In my twenties, I began pursuing computer science but stepped away from school when financial responsibility demanded it. I worked full-time, often balancing multiple roles at once, and started a family. That period forced me to grow up fast.

I spent eight years at UPS as a part-time supervisor, running sections of a warehouse where mistakes cost real money and people could get hurt. I managed up to 20 employees at a time. If something went wrong, it was on me. That experience shaped how I think about systems, accountability, and failure.

I later moved into construction at San Clemente Woodworking, starting in the shop building staircase components by hand and eventually handling installations, sales, and operations. I invested in my own tools. I learned how work actually moves from idea to execution.

All the while, I kept noticing friction. Repeated mistakes. Lost information. Manual processes that did not need to be manual.

So I went back to school while continuing to work and raise a family. Nights studying. Early mornings building. No safety net.

During that time, I gained formal engineering experience through an internship and applied what I was learning directly to real operational problems. I built internal tools. I automated quoting workflows. I replaced paper tracking systems. Eventually, those tools evolved into Paarth, a full CRM and operations system used to run real jobs for a real business.

I created Liminal Innovations and Technology as a container for the engineering work I was already doing. A way to formalize what had become inevitable.

I do not just like writing code. I like building systems that remove friction from real life.
