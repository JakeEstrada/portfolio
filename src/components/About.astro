My name is Jake Estrada.

I did not come up through internships, hackathons, or polished tech pipelines. I came up through warehouses, job sites, and responsibility.

In my twenties, I worked eight years at UPS as a part-time supervisor. I ran sections of a warehouse where mistakes cost real money and people could get hurt. I trained employees. I managed up to 20 people at a time. I learned how to own a space. If something went wrong, it was on me. That experience shaped how I think about systems and accountability.

After that, I went into construction at San Clemente Woodworking. I started in the shop building staircase parts with my hands. Then I moved into installations. I bought my own tools, miter saw, grinder, drills, nail guns, and drained my 401k to do it. Not because it was glamorous. Because I believed betting on myself was better than staying comfortable.

But what I kept noticing everywhere I worked was friction. Repeated mistakes. Lost information. Manual processes that did not need to be manual. I could not stop thinking about how things could be built better.

So I learned CAD to design renders for customers. I wrote scripts to speed up quoting. I built small programs to track things that were being tracked on scraps of paper. Eventually, those tools became something bigger.

I built Paarth, a full CRM and operations system for the business. Not as a school project. Not as a tutorial. As a real system used by real people to run real jobs. I built it so the company would not depend on tribal knowledge. So anyone could be trained. So workflows were intentional, not chaotic.

I created Liminal Innovations and Technology because I needed a container for the work I was doing. I needed to treat engineering seriously, even if no one had given me the title yet.

I did not get an internship in school. I could not afford to. I had bills. A family. Real responsibility. So I designed my own path. Nights building. Early mornings studying. Deploying things that actually had consequences if they failed.

I do not come from comfort. I come from ownership.

I do not just like writing code. I like building systems that remove friction from real life.

That is who I am.
