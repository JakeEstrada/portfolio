## Overview

This project was part of advanced coursework in Natural Language Processing, where I implemented a transformer-based NLP model from the ground up. The project involved building complete data pipelines, training models, and analyzing their behavior.

## Implementation Details

- **Data Preprocessing**: Built comprehensive pipelines for text corpus preparation
- **Model Training**: Trained transformer models on prepared datasets
- **Evaluation**: Analyzed model performance and behavior
- **Attention Mechanisms**: Gained hands-on experience with modern NLP architectures

## Technical Learnings

This project provided deep understanding of:
- Transformer architecture and attention mechanisms
- Modern NLP model training and evaluation
- Data preprocessing for NLP tasks
- Model behavior analysis and debugging

## Results

Successfully trained and evaluated transformer models, gaining practical experience with state-of-the-art NLP techniques that are foundational to modern language models.
