## Overview

These projects were part of data science coursework where I implemented fundamental machine learning algorithms from scratch and using libraries. The focus was on understanding the underlying mathematics and evaluation metrics rather than just using pre-built tools.

## Projects Included

### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Implemented KNN algorithm by hand to understand distance metrics and classification logic
- Worked with various distance metrics (Euclidean, Manhattan, etc.)
- Analyzed how k-value affects classification performance

### K-Means Clustering
- Implemented K-Means clustering algorithm from scratch
- Experimented with different initialization methods
- Analyzed convergence behavior and cluster quality

### Evaluation Metrics
- Built confusion matrices to analyze classification performance
- Calculated precision, recall, and F-scores manually
- Compared different evaluation approaches for various problem types

## Technical Implementation

All projects were built using Python with pandas for data manipulation and scikit-learn for comparison and validation. The emphasis was on building reproducible experiments and understanding the mathematical foundations of each algorithm.

## Key Learnings

- Deep understanding of distance metrics and their impact on algorithm performance
- Hands-on experience with evaluation metrics and when to use each
- Ability to implement algorithms from scratch vs. using libraries
- Building reproducible experiments and proper experimental methodology
