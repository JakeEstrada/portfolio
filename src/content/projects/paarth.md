## Overview

Paarth is a full-stack web application I designed and built as a custom CRM system specifically tailored for small construction and fabrication businesses. The system is actively used in real business operations, replacing manual spreadsheets and fragmented tools with a unified, purpose-built solution.

## Key Features

- **Custom CRM System**: Tailored workflows for construction and fabrication businesses
- **Role-Based Dashboards**: Separate interfaces for admin and employees
- **REST API Backend**: Built with Node.js and MongoDB for customers, jobs, invoices, and internal workflows
- **Third-Party Integrations**: Integrated payment APIs and data ingestion services
- **Automation Scripts**: Internal automation to streamline business processes

## Technical Implementation

The backend is built with Node.js and MongoDB, providing REST APIs for all core business functions. The React frontend delivers role-based dashboards that adapt to user permissions, ensuring employees see only what they need while admins have full system access.

## Impact

This system transformed how the business operates, moving from manual spreadsheet tracking to an integrated platform that handles customers, jobs, invoices, and workflows in one place. The system is actively used in production, demonstrating real-world value and reliability.

## Challenges & Solutions

- **Custom Workflows**: Designed the system to match existing business processes rather than forcing the business to adapt
- **Scalability**: Built with MongoDB for flexible schema evolution as business needs change
- **User Experience**: Created intuitive interfaces that require minimal training for employees
