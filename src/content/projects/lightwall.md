## Overview

Lightwall was an interactive art installation exhibited in a museum, combining light, motion, and AI to create an immersive experience. I worked on the embedded engineering aspects, programming low-level hardware controllers and integrating sensor data with higher-level AI systems.

## Technical Implementation

- **Arduino Programming**: Wrote firmware for Arduino-based controllers managing stepper motors and radar sensors
- **Sensor Integration**: Integrated real-time sensor data with AI systems controlling visual output
- **Low-Level C Code**: Wrote C code for precise hardware control and communication
- **System Integration**: Connected embedded hardware with higher-level AI systems

## Challenges

Working with real-time sensor data and motor control required precise timing and reliable communication protocols. The system needed to respond instantly to sensor input while maintaining smooth motor control for the visual installation.

## Impact

The installation successfully ran in a museum environment, demonstrating the reliability of the embedded systems and the seamless integration between hardware sensors and AI-driven visual output.
