## Overview

NanoHub is a full-stack e-commerce web application I built as my senior capstone project. The platform uses scraped and curated product data to populate a storefront, with a complete admin system for managing products, pricing, inventory, and orders. The project demonstrates end-to-end development skills from data ingestion to secure payment processing.

## Key Features

- **Data Pipeline**: Designed and implemented a data pipeline to scrape, clean, and normalize product data used to populate the storefront
- **Admin Dashboard**: Built the entire admin dashboard to manage products, pricing, inventory, and orders
- **RESTful APIs**: Developed RESTful APIs to support product browsing, purchases, order history, and admin workflows
- **Stripe Integration**: Integrated Stripe for secure payment processing and transaction handling
- **Order Management**: Implemented previous orders and order history functionality with persistent backend storage
- **Database Design**: Designed database schemas and implemented CRUD operations for products, users, and orders

## Technical Implementation

The backend architecture includes RESTful APIs built with Node.js and Express, supporting all core e-commerce functionality. The data pipeline handles scraping, cleaning, and normalization of product data, ensuring consistent and reliable product information. PostgreSQL serves as the database, with carefully designed schemas for products, users, and orders. Stripe integration provides secure payment processing, and the system maintains complete order history with persistent backend storage.

## Impact

This capstone project demonstrates full-stack engineering capabilities, from data ingestion pipelines to production-adjacent features like admin dashboards and secure payment processing. The project showcases real engineering problem-solving through the scraped data pipeline and backend credibility through comprehensive API design and order persistence systems.

## Challenges & Solutions

- **Data Ingestion**: Built a robust data pipeline to handle scraping, cleaning, and normalizing product data from multiple sources
- **Secure Payments**: Integrated Stripe API for secure checkout and transaction handling
- **Order Persistence**: Designed and implemented order history functionality with persistent backend storage
- **Full-Stack Collaboration**: Collaborated with a frontend team to connect APIs and deliver a complete end-to-end e-commerce experience
